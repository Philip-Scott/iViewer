# Remote Messages Theme

Since iViewer is basicaly just a webapp client for Remote Messages, just installing and running the application will let you use remote messages in it, but the app won't "look" like an elementary app. Half of the magic of iViewer comes from the Elementary theme here anyways, so if you would like to have the full iViewer experience, you will have to install this theme... 

### Instalation Guide
1. Make sure your device is jailbroken, and you have the tweak "Remote Messages" installed
2. Using iFile, or SSH (or any other tool to get into your device's filesystem)
	- Go to Library/Application Support/RemoteMessages/Web/
	- Replace the contents of /Web/ with the ones included in this folder 
3. Make sure the tweak is enabled on your settings
4. Once you connect to your device with iViewer, go to settings and sellect the Elementary theme
